**MiniTroid -** The Metroid-like stuck in a time loop!  
Winner of the Whalepass #2 GameJam.

**CONTROLS (Controller recommended) :  
ARROWS / D-PAD / Left Stick :** Move & Aim  
**SPACE / A :** Jump  
**M / SELECT :** Open Map  
**W / X :** Shoot  
**X / RB / RT :** Dash  
**C / LB :** Lock Character in Place (to aim more easily)  
(Some controls are locked initially)  
You can drop down ledges with **Down (hold) + Jump**.

If playing on a mobile device, the game will also display touch controls on screen.

Alternative keyboard controls: WASD (move), Shift (shoot), A (Lock), E (Dash)



**The Game:**  
The player starts the game with only **20 seconds** remaining before their suit will self-destruct. As they are _stuck in a time loop_, they are doomed to repeat these 20 seconds forever.  
Can you gather enough **knowledge** during those measly 20 seconds to discover how to open new paths and find a way to delay this curse, or even remove it completely?

**Theme - Small Actions, Big Consequences:**  
At first, it seems impossible to complete the game in only 20 seconds. But every small discovery/unlock allows you to gain more and more time little by little, until you are able to reach the final area AND beat the final boss in one single loop!  
Each small grain of sand you can gather will matter in the end.

  
**AVAX Integration:**  
Currently, the "knowledge" gathered in the game is saved on blockchain as a **WhalePass** reward, meaning that even on a new computer, connecting to your account will make it so the character knows the code for the upgrades and immediately has them.   
Players can also look at their earned unlocks on [discover.games](https://www.discover.games/)
  
I plan to add a second game mode where every player's map is different (including different upgrades), and players would need to trade "knowledge" on the blockchain with each others to be able to progress! That would make for a way cooler integration I think, but I didn't have time to complete that during the jam. I'll add it soon tho!  


  
**Miscellaneous:**  
Why codes? When the game loop, everything is reset - apart from the sand that's in the hourglass. But the ingame character is able to remember the discovered codes. As a result, they are able to unlock their suit's abilities right away at the start of a new loop, without having to go all the way back to get the upgrade again! :)

If you wanna experience the game again, you can temporarily delete your save in the Options menu ("Reset Game"). If you refresh the page, the game will load your progress from Whalepass again so your original save will be back :)
